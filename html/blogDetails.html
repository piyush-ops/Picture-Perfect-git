        <h1>5 Tips For Having Beautiful Candid Wedding Photographs</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Candid Photographs</b> are becoming increasingly popular across the
          globe. While it was just a casual trend before, it has now gained
          popularity in the formal realm. Especially in weddings, couples now
          long to be captured in a beautiful candid picture. Infact, there are
          now photographers who claim to expertise in the field of candid
          photography. And nonetheless, the hype is well deserved. Candid
          pictures have a beauty so unique that it cannot be compared to the
          ones we pose for. However, getting a good candid picture is as tough
          as Joey Tribbiani sharing his food (and we all know just how difficult
          that was). And what makes it even tougher is when you are in a wedding
          setting. And therefore, we have compiled below a few tips that would
          help you get amazing candid pictures.

          <h2>1. Be Natural</h2>
       <div class="img-wrap">
           <img
          src="../media/images/Blog/download (1).jfif"
          alt=""
        />
       </div>
          <p>
            The first rule for a candid picture is to be natural. This goes for
            the <b> Wedding Photographer </b> as well as the one being
            photographed. Itâ€™s up to the photographer to create an air of ease
            for the one being photographed. And the best way for people to get
            an exotic candid picture is to completely forget about the presence
            of a camera.

          <h2>2. Be Mindful of the Flash</h2>
          <div class="img-wrap">
            <img
           src="../media/images/Blog/download (1).jfif"
           alt=""
         />
        </div>
          <p>
            There couldnâ€™t be a way better than the flash to kill the candid
            vibe. Ofcourse, there might be times when using a flash would be
            absolutely necessary, but when not, keep it off. As a wedding
            photographer, inform the clients in advance about the kinds of
            lights thatâ€™ll help with better pictures.

          <h2>3. Make use of Burst mode</h2>
          <div class="img-wrap">
            <img
           src="../media/images/Blog/download (2).jfif"
           alt=""
         />
        </div>
          <p>
            Did you ever miss a good candid picture just by a few seconds? Well,
            with burst mode, you wonâ€™t. Weddings are places where a special,
            picture perfect moment, could occur any time. And hence, every
            photographer should be ready with his burst mode, so that he can
            capture a series of pictures quickly. This also ensures that you
            have multiple pictures of a moment, so in case you donâ€™t like one,
            you have many others to choose from.

          <h2>4. Be Discreet</h2>
          <div class="img-wrap">
            <img
           src="../media/images/Blog/download (4).jfif"
           alt=""

        </div>
          <p>
            As a photographer, being seen, might not always be a great thing. In
            order to get candid pictures, a wedding photographer should take
            pictures without being seen, this keeps the focus off the fact that
            they are being photographed. This creates a natural environment and
            hence, allows the photographer to take natural pictures. To be
            discreet, it would be advisable for the photographer to keep his
            camera on silent shooting mode and take

          <h2>5. Keep your Subjects engaged</h2>
          <div class="img-wrap">
            <img
           src="../media/images/Blog/download (5).jfif"
           alt=""
         />
        </div>
          <p>
            As a photographer, the best way to get a series of candid pictures,
            is by engaging the audience. It's much easier to take candid
            pictures by eliciting a friendly vibe rather than a more stringent
            professional vibe.
